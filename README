This program was developed (and tested) on FreeBSD 8.0. It might run on other
platforms as well, but you will most probably have tocraft your own Makefile 
(unless your platform has got bsd.prog.mk.)

vhostgen expects the following MySQL table setup:

CREATE TABLE `vhosts` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `servername` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `serveralias` varchar(255) default NULL,
  `documentroot` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `addedby` varchar(255) default NULL,
  `user` varchar(255) default NULL,
  `group` varchar(255) default NULL,
  `port` varchar(255) default '80',
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
);

You may of course call the table whatever you like, as long as you edit your
~/.vhostgenrc accordingly. Add new entries using ``vhostgen --add'' and 
use ``vhostgen'' to actually generate the vhost config file.
