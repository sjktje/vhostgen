[x] Make perrorf use a static buffer instead of mallocing.
[x] Create vhostgen --list %string%
[ ] Create vhostgen --delete [n|%string%]
    Example:
    vhostgen --delete 5 <-- deletes vhost with id 5 (obtain from vhostgen --list)
    vhostgen --delete %ankeborg% <-- delete vhosts matching "ankeborg"
[ ] Create vhostgen --dry-run
    This could be used together with --delete
        vhostgen --dry-run --delete %ankeborg.nu <- would print something like
        Would delete freebsd.ankeborg.nu
        Would delete sjk.ankeborg.nu
        Would delete ankeborg.nu
        ...
[x] Use mysql_real_escape_string() on user input going into db.
[ ] Create vhostgen --version
[ ] Make vhostgen use syslog
